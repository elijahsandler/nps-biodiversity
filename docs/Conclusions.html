            <h1>Summary and Conclusions</h1>
    
            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                Our project combined Python-based data processing with Plotly, Altair, and D3.js to generate interactive and static visualizations. We embedded dynamic dashboards into our HTML framework using iframe and script-based integrations. These interactive elements enabled users to filter, hover, and explore key park-level metrics directly within the browser which allowed for a more hands on, intuitive understanding of the dataset than static graphs alone could provide.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>High Biodiversity Often Coincides with High Visitation:</strong> We can see that parks like the Great Smoky Mountains and Yosemite have large species counts along with millions of annual visitors. While this reflects their ecological and recreational value, it also raises the stakes for effective conservation management as the impact of humans in the area also increases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Species Richness Varies by Region and Park Type:</strong> The Great Smoky Mountains, with its high insect diversity, leads in total species count. California’s Redwood National Park is the only other park to exceed 6,000 catalogued species. In contrast, parks in Alaska and the Midwest tend to show lower overall biodiversity, which reflects differences in ecosystem types as well as cataloging effort.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Conservation Pressure is Concentrated in Specific Parks:</strong> Some parks see a disproportionate amount of conservation concerns. Death Valley has the most species of concern, while Hawai‘i Volcanoes has the highest number of endangered mammals. These parks may require focused conservation efforts due to their vulnerable ecosystems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tourism Can Be Both a Risk and a Resource:</strong> While parks in the Intermountain and Pacific West regions attract high visitation and show strong biodiversity, they also face increased conservation risks due to high human activity. On the other hand, despite their ecological value, less-visited parks may suffer from underfunding or lower conservation attention.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Regional Patterns Suggest Need for Tailored Strategies:</strong> A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be effective for tourism and conservation. Alaska’s parks, for example, show lower visitation and fewer species of concern, which demonstrates that conservation strategies must consider both ecological and human factors unique to each region.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Interactivity and Presentation Value</h2>
            <p>
                Interactivity played a key role in enhancing our visual storytelling. Hover-based tooltips in maps and dashboards allow viewers to engage directly with data values, such as exact visitation counts, park acreage, and species totals. The treemap layout allowed users to visually compare park importance and groupings by state and region, while the time-series line chart offered insight into how visit trends evolved across two decades. This combination of interactivity and design clarity helps highlight outliers, clusters, and patterns more effectively than static charts. We were also able to leverage Plotly's built in interactivity to allow users to filter by region and conservation status, as well as zoom in on parts of the chart.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>
                Our analysis is based on relatively granular data. We know of the existence of species in the parks, but not their locations or counts. This means that we cannot make any conclusions about the health of the species or their populations beyond their official conservation status. Our visitation data is also limited to what is described as "recreational visits," which does not include other types of park engagement such as education or research. <br><br>Some datasets were also missing parks: Indiana Dunes, Virgin Islands, and American Samoa were not included, among others, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon were combined into a single observation, which means we lost even more granularity. 

            </p>
    
            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>
                Incorporating additional data such as more fine grained species counts, park land use, and in-depth visitation data would allow us to make more robust conclusions about the health of the parks and their species, and some of the connections between these variables. Land use and visitation are controlable and predictable, so understanding the impact of these variables on species health could be very useful as we fight for species conservation.
