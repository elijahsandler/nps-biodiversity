            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                National parks play an important role in both conserving biodiversity and supporting tourism. In this project, we analyzed trends across 56 U.S. national parks from 2003–2022, focusing on species diversity, conservation status, visitation patterns, and regional differences. Using interactive visualizations, we explored where biodiversity is the most concentrated, which parks face the greatest conservation pressures, and how visitation trends may relate to ecological outcomes. Our goal is to better understand the intersection between tourism and conservation to inform sustainable park management.

            <h2>Project Tasks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze species richness and conservation status across national parks</li>
                <li>Explore the distribution of endangered, threatened, and non-native species</li>
                <li>Investigate how park size, region, and visitation patterns relate to biodiversity and conservation outcomes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Description</h2>
            <p><strong>Species Dataset:</strong> 119,248 species records across all animal and plant categories in U.S. national parks</p>
            <p><strong>Mammals Subset:</strong> 3,867 rows filtered from the full dataset to include only mammals across 56 parks</p>
            <p><strong>Visitation Data:</strong> 2,846 records from 2003–2022 showing annual recreational visits by park</p>
            <p><strong>Time Period:</strong> 2003–2022</p>
            <p><strong>Data Source:</strong> <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/" target="_blank">National Park Service IRMA Portal</a></p>

            <h3>Key Attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Park Name</strong> — Identifies the national park each species is observed in</li>
                <li><strong>Common and Scientific Names</strong> — Names for each species</li>
                <li><strong>Category, Order, Family</strong> — Taxonomic classifications</li>
                <li><strong>Occurrence, Nativeness, Abundance</strong> — Ecological presence and status of species in the park</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonality</strong> — Seasonal presence of the species</li>
                <li><strong>Conservation Status</strong> — Indicates species listed as endangered, threatened, or species of concern</li>
                <li><strong>Recreation Visits</strong> — Annual number of visitors per park (in visits.csv)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Processing</h3>
            <p>
                We began by filtering the full species dataset to focus on mammals, reducing the dataset from over 119,000 records to 3,867. We merged this with park-level visitation data and cleaned missing or inconsistent values across fields like occurrence, seasonality, and conservation status. We also computed new fields, including mammal species density (species per square km) and endangered species counts per park to support richer visual exploration.
